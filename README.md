# Axela.
An AI chatbot to help you with anything!! ðŸ˜„
<br>In case you wondered, Axela is *not* a ChatGPT client and uses its own (simple) AI engine that is coded into the program itself (included inside MainPage.xaml.cs, in a function), not as a separate module. This approach enables Axela to work offline, though Wikipedia support (run by the Wikipedia support Python module) requires an Internet connection to get data from Wikipedia. These unique features set it apart, as the majority of chatbot apps today are just chatGPT clients... 
<br>Currently in Stable, don't expect *loads* of functionality from it yet (as it is not fully featured yet), but please check here regularly, as there will be new features and commands added!

### How to install
#### If you want to get versions 11.2401.1.0 and earlier:
You have to extract the zip file and then run Axela by running Axela Beta.exe (if you want to use the beta version) or Axela.exe (if you want to use the stable version).
You can also manually create a desktop and start menu shortcut.
#### If you want to get versions 11.2404.1.0 and later:
Download AxelaSetup.exe from Releases and run it, proceeding through the steps in the Setup. It will install Axela for you, unlike in the earlier method, and you can launch Axela automatically after the installation has finished. This method automatically creates a start menu shortcut and gives you the option to create a desktop shortcut.
