# Axela.
An AI chatbot to help you with anything!! ðŸ˜„
<br>In case you wondered, Axela is *not* a ChatGPT client and uses its own (simple) AI engine that is coded into the program itself (included inside MainPage.xaml.cs, in a function), not as a separate module. This approach enables Axela to work offline, though Wikipedia support (run by the Wikipedia support Python module) requires an Internet connection to get data from Wikipedia. These unique features set it apart, as the majority of chatbot apps today are just chatGPT clients... 
<br>Currently in Stable, don't expect *loads* of functionality from it yet (as it is not fully featured yet), but please check here regularly, as there will be new features and commands added!

### How to install
Since Axela's installer kept crashing, I decided to distribute it as a zip file. (Will be fixed in next version however, as I recently found a solution)
You have to extract the zip file and then run Axela by running Axela Beta.exe (if you want to use the beta version) or Axela.exe (if you want to use the stable version).
You can also manually create a desktop and start menu shortcut.
