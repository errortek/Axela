# Axela.
An AI chatbot to help you with anything!! ðŸ˜„
<br>In case you wondered, Axela is *not* a ChatGPT client and uses its own (simple) AI engine that is coded into the program itself (included inside MainPage.xaml.cs, in a function), not as a separate module. This approach enables Axela to work offline, though I do plan to add Wikipedia support to increase the usefulness of this AI chatbot. These unique features set it apart, as the majority of chatbot apps today are just chatGPT clients... 
<br>Currently in Beta, don't expect *loads* of functionality from it yet, but please check here regularly, as there will be new features and commands added!

### How to install
Since Axela in an Installer kept crashing, I decided to distribute it as a zip file.
You have to extract the zip file and then run Axela by running Axela Beta.exe.
You can also manually create a desktop and start menu shortcut.
